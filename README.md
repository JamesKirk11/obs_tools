## Tools for observing with ACAM

**quick_look.py** quickly extracts the spectral traces from a single file for either 1 or 2 windows and plots them. This is pretty rough and does not 
account for curvature of the traces but is useful when selecting a spectral line for tracking with xy_centroids.py

**xy_centroids.py** tracks the movement in x and y (given a spectral line) throughout all science FITS files within the current directory.
